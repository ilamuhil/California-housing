# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on building a predictive model for housing prices using machine learning techniques, inspired by Chapter 2 of Aurélien Géron's book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow." The primary aim is to demonstrate the entire machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.

## Features

The dataset used in this project consists of 20,640 entries and 10 columns, including the following features:

-  **longitude**: The longitude of the house location (float).
-  **latitude**: The latitude of the house location (float).
-  **housing_median_age**: The median age of the houses in the area (float).
-  **total_rooms**: The total number of rooms in the house (float).
-  **total_bedrooms**: The total number of bedrooms in the house (float).
-  **population**: The total population of the area (float).
-  **households**: The total number of households in the area (float).
-  **median_income**: The median income of the households in the area (float).
-  **median_house_value**: The target variable representing the median house value (float).
-  **ocean_proximity**: The proximity of the house to the ocean (categorical).

### Summary Statistics

-  **Mean Median House Value**: ₹206,855.82
-  **Median Income**: ₹3.87
-  **Mean Total Rooms**: 2,635.76
-  **Mean Total Bedrooms**: 537.87
-  **Ocean Proximity Distribution**:
  - `<1H OCEAN`: 9,136
  - `INLAND`: 6,551
  - `NEAR OCEAN`: 2,658
  - `NEAR BAY`: 2,290
  - `ISLAND`: 5

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
-  To preprocess and clean the data to make it suitable for modeling.
-  To explore and visualize the data to uncover insights and patterns.
-  To train and evaluate different machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
-  To make predictions on new, unseen data and assess the model's performance.

By the end of this project, we aim to achieve a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast housing prices based on the input features, providing valuable insights and contributing to informed decision-making.
